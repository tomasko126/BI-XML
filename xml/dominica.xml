        Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be colonized by Europeans due chiefly to the fierce resistance
        of the native Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which colonized the island in 1805. In
        1980, two years after independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration
        was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in
        office for 15 years. On 18 September 2017, Hurricane Maria passed over the island causing extensive damage to
        structures, roads, communications, and the power supply, and largely destroying critical agricultural areas.

    <economy>
        <overview>
            The Dominican economy has been dependent on agriculture - primarily bananas - in years past, but
            increasingly has been driven by tourism as the government seeks to promote Dominica as an "ecotourism"
            destination. Moreover, Dominica has an offshore medical education sector. In order to diversify the island's
            economy, the government is also attempting to foster an offshore financial industry and plans to sign
            agreements with the private sector to develop geothermal energy resources. In 2003, the government began a
            comprehensive restructuring of the economy - including the elimination of price controls, privatization of
            the state banana company, and tax increases - to address an economic and financial crisis and to meet IMF
            requirements. In 2009 and 2013, the economy contracted as a result of the global recession; growth remains
            anemic. Although public debt levels continue to exceed pre-recession levels, the debt burden declined from
            78% of GDP in 2011 to approximately 70% in 2012.

            Dominica is the only Caribbean state to challenge Venezuela's sovereignty claim over Aves Island and joins
            the other island nations in challenging whether the feature sustains human habitation, a criterion under the
            UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which permits Venezuela to extend its EEZ and continental shelf claims
            over a large portion of the eastern Caribbean Sea
