               caption="The Republic of Seychelles is an island country spanning an archipelago of 155 islands in the Indian Ocean. It is about 1,500 km (930 mi) east of the African continent, and spreads out over a vast area of ocean north of Madagascar. Independent from the UK since 1976, the country nevertheless is far more French after years of early French settlement and influence. Since independence, tourism has grown dramatically to become the primary industry of Seychelles, overtaking plantation agriculture.

        A lengthy struggle between France and Great Britain for the islands ended in 1814, when they were ceded to the
        latter. Independence came in 1976. Single-party rule was brought to a close with a new constitution and free
        elections in 1993. President France-Albert RENE, who had served since 1977, was reelected in 2001, but stepped
        down in 2004. Vice President James Alix MICHEL took over the presidency and in July 2006 was elected to a new
        five-year term; he was reelected in May 2011 and again in December 2015. In October 2016, James MICHEL resigned
        and handed over the presidency to his Vice-President Danny FAURE.

    <economy>
        <overview>
            Since independence in 1976, per capita output in this Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven
            times the pre-independence, near-subsistence level, moving the island into the upper-middle-income group of
            countries. Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and
            provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by tuna fishing.
            In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and other services. At
            the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of
            farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing.
            In 2008, having depleted its foreign exchange reserves, Seychelles defaulted on interest payments due on a
            $230 million Eurobond, requested assistance from the IMF, and immediately enacted a number of significant
            structural reforms, including liberalization of the exchange rate, reform of the public sector to include
            layoffs, and the sale of some state assets. In December 2013, the IMF declared that Seychelles had
            successfully transitioned to a market-based economy with full employment and a fiscal surplus. Effective 1
            January 2017, Seychelles will no longer be eligible for trade benefits under the US African Growth and
            Opportunities Act after having gained developed country status. Seychelles grew at 4.9% in 2016 because of a
            strong tourist sector and low commodity prices; its fiscal surplus reached 3% of GDP. The Seychellois
            Government met the IMF’s performance criteria for 2016 but recognizes a need to make additional progress to
            combat high poverty levels, estimated at 39% in 2013.
