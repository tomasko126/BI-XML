         <p id="background">
            Carib Indians occupied the islands of the West Indies for hundreds of years before
            the British began settlement
            in 1623. In 1967, the island territory of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla became
            an associated state of the UK
            with full internal autonomy. The island of Anguilla rebelled and was allowed to secede
            in 1971. The remaining
            islands achieved independence in 1983 as Saint Kitts and Nevis. In 1998, a referendum
            on Nevis to separate from
            Saint Kitts fell short of the two-thirds majority vote needed. Nevis continues in
            its efforts to separate from
            Saint Kitts.

                     The economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis depends on tourism; since the 1970s, tourism
                     has replaced sugar as the
                     economy’s traditional mainstay. Roughly 200,000 tourists visited the islands in 2009,
                     but reduced tourism
                     arrivals and foreign investment led to an economic contraction in the 2009-2013 period,
                     and the economy
                     returned to growth only in 2014. Like other tourist destinations in the Caribbean,
                     Saint Kitts and Nevis is
                     vulnerable to damage from natural disasters and shifts in tourism demand.
                     Following the 2005 harvest, the government closed the sugar industry after several
                     decades of losses. To
                     compensate for lost jobs, the government has embarked on a program to diversify the
                     agricultural sector and
                     to stimulate other sectors of the economy, such as export-oriented manufacturing and
                     offshore banking. The
                     government has made notable progress in reducing its public debt, from 154% of GDP
                     in 2011 to 83% in 2013,
                     although it still faces one of the highest levels in the world, largely attributable
                     to public enterprise
                     losses. Saint Kitts and Nevis is among other countries in the Caribbean that supplement
                     their economic
                     activity through economic citizenship programs, whereby foreigners can obtain citizenship
                     from Saint Kitts
                     and Nevis by investing there.
