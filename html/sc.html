         <h5>Background</h5>
         <p id="background">
            A lengthy struggle between France and Great Britain for the islands ended in 1814,
            when they were ceded to the
            latter. Independence came in 1976. Single-party rule was brought to a close with a
            new constitution and free
            elections in 1993. President France-Albert RENE, who had served since 1977, was reelected
            in 2001, but stepped
            down in 2004. Vice President James Alix MICHEL took over the presidency and in July
            2006 was elected to a new
            five-year term; he was reelected in May 2011 and again in December 2015. In October
            2016, James MICHEL resigned
            and handed over the presidency to his Vice-President Danny FAURE.

                     Since independence in 1976, per capita output in this Indian Ocean archipelago has
                     expanded to roughly seven
                     times the pre-independence, near-subsistence level, moving the island into the upper-middle-income
                     group of
                     countries. Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the
                     labor force and
                     provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by tuna fishing.
                     In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels
                     and other services. At
                     the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting
                     the development of
                     farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing.
                     In 2008, having depleted its foreign exchange reserves, Seychelles defaulted on interest
                     payments due on a
                     $230 million Eurobond, requested assistance from the IMF, and immediately enacted
                     a number of significant
                     structural reforms, including liberalization of the exchange rate, reform of the public
                     sector to include
                     layoffs, and the sale of some state assets. In December 2013, the IMF declared that
                     Seychelles had
                     successfully transitioned to a market-based economy with full employment and a fiscal
                     surplus. Effective 1
                     January 2017, Seychelles will no longer be eligible for trade benefits under the US
                     African Growth and
                     Opportunities Act after having gained developed country status. Seychelles grew at
                     4.9% in 2016 because of a
                     strong tourist sector and low commodity prices; its fiscal surplus reached 3% of GDP.
                     The Seychellois
                     Government met the IMF’s performance criteria for 2016 but recognizes a need to make
                     additional progress to
                     combat high poverty levels, estimated at 39% in 2013.
