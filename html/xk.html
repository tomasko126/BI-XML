         <h5>Background</h5>
         <p id="background">
            The central Balkans were part of the Roman and Byzantine Empires before ethnic Serbs
            migrated to the territories
            of modern Kosovo in the 7th century. During the medieval period, Kosovo became the
            center of a Serbian Empire
            and saw the construction of many important Serb religious sites, including many architecturally
            significant
            Serbian Orthodox monasteries. The defeat of Serbian forces at the Battle of Kosovo
            in 1389 led to five centuries
            of Ottoman rule during which large numbers of Turks and Albanians moved to Kosovo.
            By the end of the 19th
            century, Albanians replaced Serbs as the dominant ethnic group in Kosovo. Serbia reacquired
            control over the
            region from the Ottoman Empire during the First Balkan War of 1912. After World War
            II, Kosovo's present-day
            boundaries were established when Kosovo became an autonomous province of Serbia in
            the Socialist Federal
            Republic of Yugoslavia (S.F.R.Y.). Despite legislative concessions, Albanian nationalism
            increased in the 1980s,
            which led to riots and calls for Kosovo's independence. The Serbs - many of whom viewed
            Kosovo as their cultural
            heartland - instituted a new constitution in 1989 revoking Kosovo's autonomous status.
            Kosovo's Albanian leaders
            responded in 1991 by organizing a referendum declaring Kosovo independent. Serbia
            undertook repressive measures
            against the Kosovar Albanians in the 1990s, provoking a Kosovar Albanian insurgency.
            Beginning in 1998, Serbia
            conducted a brutal counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive
            expulsions of ethnic
            Albanians (some 800,000 ethnic Albanians were forced from their homes in Kosovo).
            After international attempts
            to mediate the conflict failed, a three-month NATO military operation against Serbia
            beginning in March 1999
            forced the Serbs to agree to withdraw their military and police forces from Kosovo.
            UN Security Council
            Resolution 1244 (1999) placed Kosovo under a transitional administration, the UN Interim
            Administration Mission
            in Kosovo (UNMIK), pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. A UN-led process
            began in late 2005 to
            determine Kosovo's final status. The 2006-07 negotiations ended without agreement
            between Belgrade and Pristina,
            though the UN issued a comprehensive report on Kosovo's final status that endorsed
            independence. On 17 February
            2008, the Kosovo Assembly declared Kosovo independent. Since then, over 110 countries
            have recognized Kosovo,
            and it has joined numerous international organizations. In October 2008, Serbia sought
            an advisory opinion from
            the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality under international law of
            Kosovo's declaration of
            independence. The ICJ released the advisory opinion in July 2010 affirming that Kosovo's
            declaration of
            independence did not violate general principles of international law, UN Security
            Council Resolution 1244, or
            the Constitutive Framework. The opinion was closely tailored to Kosovo's unique history
            and circumstances.
            Demonstrating Kosovoâ€™s development into a sovereign, multi-ethnic, democratic country
            the international
            community ended the period of Supervised Independence in 2012. Elections were held
            throughout Kosovo in 2013 and
            2014, at the municipal and national level respectively. Serbia continues to reject
            Kosovo's independence, but
            the two countries reached an agreement to normalize their relations in April 2013
            through EU-facilitated talks
            and are currently engaged in the implementation process. Kosovo seeks full integration
            into the international
            community, and has pursued bilateral recognitions and eventual membership in international
            organizations, such
            as the UN, EU, and NATO.

                     Kosovo's economy has shown progress in transitioning to a market-based system and
                     maintaining macroeconomic
                     stability, but it is still highly dependent on the international community and the
                     diaspora for financial
                     and technical assistance. Remittances from the diaspora - located mainly in Germany,
                     Switzerland, and the
                     Nordic countries - are estimated to account for about 17% of GDP and international
                     donor assistance accounts
                     for approximately 10% of GDP. With international assistance, Kosovo has been able
                     to privatize a majority of
                     its state-owned enterprises. Kosovo's citizens are the second poorest in Europe, after
                     Moldova, with a per
                     capita GDP (PPP) of $9,600 in 2016. An unemployment rate of 33%, and a youth unemployment
                     rate near 60%, in
                     a country where the average age is 26, encourages emigration and fuels a significant
                     informal, unreported
                     economy. Emigration remains challenging, however, because Kosovo lacks visa-free travel
                     to the EU. Most of
                     Kosovo's population lives in rural towns outside of the capital, Pristina. Inefficient,
                     near-subsistence
                     farming is common - the result of small plots, limited mechanization, and a lack of
                     technical expertise.
                     Kosovo enjoys lower labor costs than the rest of the region. However, high levels
                     of corruption, little
                     contract enforcement, and unreliable electricity supply have discouraged potential
                     investors. The official
                     currency of Kosovo is the euro, but the Serbian dinar is also used illegally in Serb
                     majority communities.
                     Kosovo's tie to the euro has helped keep core inflation low. Minerals and metals production
                     - including
                     lignite, lead, zinc, nickel, chrome, aluminum, magnesium, and a wide variety of construction
                     materials -
                     once the backbone of industry, has declined because of aging equipment and insufficient
                     investment, problems
                     exacerbated by competing and unresolved ownership claims of Kosovoâ€™s largest mines.
                     A limited and unreliable
                     electricity supply is a major impediment to economic development, but Kosovo has received
                     technical
                     assistance to help improve the sectorâ€™s performance. In 2012, Kosovo privatized its
                     electricity supply and
                     distribution network. The US Government is cooperating with the Ministry of Economic
                     Development (MED) and
                     the World Bank to conclude a commercial tender for the construction of Kosovo C, a
                     new lignite-fired power
                     plant that would leverage Kosovoâ€™s large lignite reserves. MED also has plans for
                     the rehabilitation of an
                     older coal power plant, Kosovo B, and the development of a coal mine that could supply
                     both plants. In June
                     2009, Kosovo joined the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and began servicing
                     its share of the
                     former Yugoslavia's debt. In order to help integrate Kosovo into regional economic
                     structures, UNMIK signed
                     (on behalf of Kosovo) its accession to the Central Europe Free Trade Area (CEFTA)
                     in 2006. Kosovo joined the
                     European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 2012 and the Council of Europe
                     Development Bank in 2013.
                     In 2016, Kosovo implemented the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations
                     with the EU,
                     focused on trade liberalization. Under the SAA, Kosovo â€” which gets approximately
                     58% of government revenue
                     from tariffs on imports â€” is required to phase out tariffs on EU goods over the next
                     seven years. In 2014,
                     nearly 60% of customs duty-eligible imports into Kosovo were EU goods. In 2015, Kosovo
                     negotiated a $185
                     million Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF following the conclusion of its previous
                     SBA in 2014. The
                     IMF requested an extension of the current SBA to August 2017 to facilitate policy
                     continuity and allow
                     sufficient time for ongoing structural reforms to progress. In August 2015, as part
                     of its EU-facilitated
                     normalization process with Serbia, Kosovo signed agreements on telecommunications
                     and energy distribution,
                     but disagreements over who owns economic assets, such as the Trepca mining conglomerate,
                     within Kosovo
                     continue. Kosovo experienced its first federal budget deficit in 2012, when government
                     expenditures climbed
                     sharply. In May 2014, the government introduced a 25% salary increase for public sector
                     employees and an
                     equal increase in certain social benefits. Central revenues could not sustain these
                     increases, and the
                     government was forced to reduce its planned capital investments. The government, led
                     by Prime Minister
                     MUSTAFA - a trained economist - recently made several changes to its fiscal policy,
                     expanding the list of
                     duty-free imports, decreasing the Value Added Tax (VAT) for basic food items and public
                     utilities, and
                     increasing the VAT for all other goods. While Kosovoâ€™s economy continued to make progress,
                     it needs further
                     reform and investment to enable the level of growth required to reduce unemployment
                     and raise living
                     standards in a meaningful way.
